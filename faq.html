                        60% of web traffic coming from mobile devices in New Zealand, mobile-first design is essential. Your
                        site will look great and function perfectly on all devices – smartphones, tablets, laptops, and
                        desktops. I test thoroughly across different screen sizes and browsers.

                        While I'm based in Wanganui, I work with clients throughout New Zealand and Australia. Most
                        communication happens online via email and project management tools, making location
                        irrelevant. I've successfully completed projects for businesses in Auckland, the Taranaki, the Waikato,
                        and other regions. Remote collaboration allows me to serve clients anywhere while maintaining
                        high-quality, personalized service.
